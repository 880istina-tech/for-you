        Sometimes one person makes ordinary days a little brighter.  
        And I just want to be close to you.  
        Every moment with you feels more precious, and I catch myself thinking about you more than I probably should.

        I love how you smile, even when you act like everything is normal.  
        Your beautiful brown eyes, your charm and gentle energy make me smile and feel warmth.  
        Being with you is easy and pleasant, every moment beside you feels special.  
        Our phone conversations may not be long, but they warm me more than words can convey.  
        You know how to make an ordinary day bright and calm.

        Being with you allows me to be myself, without pretending or trying.  
        I love your lightness, your energy, and how simple it is to communicate with you.  
        Every day spent with you makes me happier.  
        I catch myself thinking about you, smiling at our conversations, and wishing these moments could last longer.

      I don't know where this will lead,  
      but I enjoy walking this path with you.  
      Being close to you feels calm and pleasant.  
      Perhaps this is just the beginning.
